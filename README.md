this is a really cool arkanoid game project i made!,
it's a basic arkanoid game with a lot of features like new added levels, you can also choose the order in which you run the levels at runtime!, each level has a different design 
that was made manually , there are other great features like a pause screen a win/lose screen a score counter and so on.
you can simply run the program and the program will run levels 1-4 automatically , however if you want to choose the levels you want to play you can pass in the number of each
level in the order that you like and it will run the levels (repetition is allowed).
enjoy!
